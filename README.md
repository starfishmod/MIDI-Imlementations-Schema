# MIDI-Implementations-Schema


The goal of the MIDI Implementations Schema (MIS) is to provide an open standard method to describe MIDI implementations for any device. Allowing humans and computers to understand how to interface and see what capabilities their equipment has.

Inspired by such schemas such as the [OAI (swagger)](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) this will hopefully create a way for any software to take advantage of MIDI equipment in new and exciting ways that will ease any musicians workflow and creativity.

## Current Version
The current version is very alpha and requires review. Please post suggestions, errors, questions via the Github Issues.

You can find the current version in this repository.


## Specification
The specfication uses JSON-Schema-v4. It intends to cover all aspects of any MIDI device including Sysex.

## Tools and Library
Tools are available in this repository to generate and test MIS files.
A library of various equipment is also available. This repository will also accept pull request for generated MIS files.
